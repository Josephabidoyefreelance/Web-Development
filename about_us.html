            are driving the growth of Africa’s fashion and food industries and helping to create new and global opportunities for the continent’s incredibly young population.

            In line with this vision, we are constantly pioneering ground-breaking ideas that offer customers more value beyond banking, such as Habari, an integrated digital platform that connects customers to anything they need, from e-commerce to music, in one place.             We are also revolutionizing access to consumer loans with our first-of-its-kind digital lending product, Quick Credit, which gives individuals and small businesses instant, real-time access to loans anytime, anywhere.</p>
